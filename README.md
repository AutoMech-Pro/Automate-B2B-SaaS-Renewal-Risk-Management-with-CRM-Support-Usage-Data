# Automate-B2B-SaaS-Renewal-Risk-Management-with-CRM-Support-Usage-Data
Proactively flag high-value customers showing signs of churn by unifying data from CRM, Support, and Usage databases into a single automated "Risk Score."
 "Automating B2B SaaS Renewal Risk Management".

Here is the plan for the SPA Infographic:

1.  **Palette:** I have selected a **"Vibrant Cyber-SaaS"** palette featuring deep Indigo (`#4F46E5`), Electric Pink (`#EC4899`), and Bright Cyan (`#06B6D4`) to reflect the modern, tech-focused nature of n8n and SaaS data.
2.  **Structure:**
    * **Header:** Hook and Definition.
    * **The Architecture:** A structured HTML-based flowchart showing the data pipeline (CRM -> Support -> Usage -> n8n).
    * **The Logic:** A breakdown of the Javascript "Risk Scoring" algorithm using a Donut chart for weight distribution.
    * **Data Simulation:** A dashboard section visualizing a hypothetical run of this automation:
        * *Risk Distribution:* Pie Chart.
        * *Risk Correlation (3D):* Plotly 3D Scatter comparing Utilization, Tickets, and Recency.
        * *Trend Analysis:* Line chart showing risk detection over time.
3.  **Visualizations:**
    * **Flow:** HTML/CSS Cards (No Mermaid/SVG).
    * **Weights:** Chart.js Donut (Standard comparison).
    * **Risk Correlations:** Plotly.js 3D Scatter (WebGL/Canvas for complex relationship).
    * **Trends:** Chart.js Line.
